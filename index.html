Answer the following two questions.
    </h1>
    <h1>
      <ul>
        <li>
          First, Explain the hardest thing that you have learned(in relation to content) , and now understand in the class. Your explanation should be geared towards helping someone, in the class, that does not understand it to reach your level of understanding.
        </li>
        <li>
          Second, Explain the hardest thing that you have not yet understood in the class. Your explanation should describe the what and why of your misunderstanding. A statement of simply "I don't get it", or "it makes no sense" will receive 0 marks. You must go on to explain why it makes no sense, that requires that you pinpoint the portion that doesn't fit into your mental model. If you find that you completely understand the material we have covered so far, then write about a question that you have on where all of this content is taking us.
