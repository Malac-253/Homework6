          First, Explain the hardest thing that you have learned(in relation to content) , and now understand in the class. Your explanation should be geared towards helping someone, in the class, that does not understand it to reach your level of understanding.
        </li>
        <li>
          Second, Explain the hardest thing that you have not yet understood in the class. Your explanation should describe the what and why of your misunderstanding. A statement of simply "I don't get it", or "it makes no sense" will receive 0 marks. You must go on to explain why it makes no sense, that requires that you pinpoint the portion that doesn't fit into your mental model. If you find that you completely understand the material we have covered so far, then write about a question that you have on where all of this content is taking us.

           The hardest thing for me to understand was the stuff we did this week with the core D3 arg, but after the lab I think I explain it alot better. The Core D3 arg allow us to get data and use it to manipulate these structural elements of HTML.  Terms of actual syntax in human language,  Our 1st job is to give the code a promise of the data,  So that the computer knows  What to do with the data already rather than wait for it to get their.  Once we have the data we may need to map it but in most cases were simply  Using javascript to append an existing section of each team and then selecting what we would like to create in the htm or and binding the data to that.  The next step would be to create the non existent elements that to date has been blinded to.

            Will we did this we can class was probably the most interesting thing I've done in csc my entire time at center college.  Whether this is because I'm working harder in class or because it pertains to the subject that originally made me wanna be a computer scientists, I believe I fully understand what we are doing.  I can see how we can structure a page of HTML design the page with CSS and provide substance in the page with javascript.  But with all these elements it seems like we have already gotten to where we need to be to create actual pages like What CS professionals create I'm curious to see where we're gonna go.  I guess my question is how more can be manipulated a Web page to our own design ?
