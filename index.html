        <td><i>Zen Garden</i>  is interesting because of how differently it employs color Shapes and division of <br />
        the text to attract your attention, and please your eyes. Furthermore because this site comes in <br />
        many different versions you get to see all the different ways the webpage could have turned out <br />
        which also makes it interesting for me.<br /></td>

        <em>Aspect 1: Border, margin and, padding</em><br />
        In the past when studying computer science I had overlooked things like borders and margin and padding. <br />
        After the reading and seeing how nice the Middle Century Modern looks, I realize that these properties <br />
        are very helpful for ensuring everything has good spacing on the page as well as simply providing design <br />
        freedom. Examples in the book you can clearly see how different margin and padding can make a web page look, <br />
        And with The screen filler template, I see how good a wedpage will look if this is used correctly.<br />

        <em>Aspect 2:Border images</em><br />
        In the design “Fountain kiss”, Where images are used to create a beautiful area surrounding the divisions <br />
        on the page. This can be accomplished by declaring a border image in the CSS File and moving it to images file.<br />

        <em>Aspect 3: Rounded corners (Not in the book)</em><br />
        A simple yet important feature, Rounded Corners can simply be done by adding a border Radius.
